# NodeJS TODOs API

## Introduction
This repository contains all the code developed on the #01 challenge of the Ignite Node.js course.

## Techs
- Javascript
- Express

- Jest

## Objective
The objective was to create an API which allowed the user to create an account and manage (create/update/delete) todos.
There were 10 pre made integration tests, to allow me to monitor my progress on the challenge, so, to consider the challenge done, all 10 should be passing in the end.

## Status
Done!
